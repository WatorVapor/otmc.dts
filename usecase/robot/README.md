# Robot Domain MinIO Data Storage and Synchronization Solution

## 1. Background and Objectives

- **Background**:
  - Mobile robots, autonomous vehicles, and AGVs generate large amounts of data during operation:
    - Sensor data (LiDAR, IMU, GPS)
    - Video/image streams
    - Logs and status information
    - Maps and navigation data
  - Data needs to be quickly accessed locally on the robot and uploaded to the cloud for centralized management, analysis, and algorithm optimization.
- **Objectives**:
  1. Local MinIO on robots provides low-latency storage and caching capabilities
  2. Cloud MinIO provides centralized storage, analysis, and backup capabilities
  3. Support real-time critical data synchronization, batch uploads, and resumable transfers
  4. Support multi-robot, multi-scenario deployments for unified management

## 5. Data Synchronization Strategy

### Synchronization Method Selection

| Solution | Advantages | Disadvantages | Applicable Scenarios |
|------|------|------|----------|
| mc mirror | Official support, simple | No queue, network interruption requires retry | Small to medium robot fleets |
| rclone | Flexible, speed limiting, incremental | Slightly complex configuration | Large data volumes or complex sync strategies |
| Custom SDK | Controllable queue, sharding, resumable transfers | High development cost | Large-scale robot scenarios |
| MinIO Gateway + Replication | Native S3 replication | Requires cloud support | Enterprise-level OTA / data replication |

### Synchronization Modes

## 6. Security and Management

- **Identity Authentication**:
  - Independent Access Key / Secret Key for each robot
- **Transport Encryption**:
  - TLS / HTTPS
- **Storage Encryption**:
  - MinIO SSE-S3 / SSE-C
- **Access Control**:
  - Bucket policies or IAM to control permissions for different robot groups
- **Data Integrity**:
  - Object checksums, ensuring synchronized data correctness
- **Audit Logs**:
  - Recording of synchronization status, anomalies, retry counts

## 7. Technical Implementation Examples

### Robot-side Scheduled Synchronization to Cloud (Shell Script)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Configure aliases
mc alias set cloud-minio https://minio.cloud.example.com CLOUD_KEY CLOUD_SECRET
mc alias set robot-minio http://127.0.0.1:9000 ROBOT_KEY ROBOT_SECRET

# Synchronize data (maps, logs, sensor data)
mc mirror --overwrite --remove --parallel 4 robot-minio/robot-data cloud-minio/robot-data >> /var/log/minio-sync.log 2>&1
```

### Crontab Scheduled Task Example

```bash
# Synchronize at 2 AM daily
0 2 * * * /usr/local/bin/mc mirror --overwrite --remove robot-minio/robot-data cloud-minio/robot-data >> /var/log/minio-sync.log 2>&1
```

## 8. Commercial License Risks for Robot-side MinIO

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Choose MinIO version] --> B{Community vs Enterprise}
    B --> C[Community Edition AGPL v3]
    B --> D[Enterprise Edition Commercial license]

    C --> E[Closed-source commercial use has risks]
    C --> F[Modified source code must be disclosed]
    C --> G[Network access triggers source code disclosure]

    D --> H[Closed-source commercial use allowed]
    D --> I[Enterprise support and SLA provided]
    D --> J[Additional security and management features]
```

- **Community Edition AGPL v3 Risks**:
  - Source code must be disclosed when modified or providing network access service
  - Closed-source commercial use may violate the license
- **Enterprise Edition Lower Risk**:
  - Commercial license allows closed-source deployment
  - Enterprise-level support, SLA, additional security features
